\begin{abstract}
We present a complete resolution of Maxwell's Demon paradox through the theory of categorical phase-lock networks. The standard formulation asks how a demon can sort molecules by kinetic energy without violating the second law of thermodynamics, with proposed resolutions invoking information-theoretic costs of measurement and memory erasure. We demonstrate that this framing is fundamentally misconceived: there is no demon because there is no sorting by kinetic energy. Gas molecules exist in phase-lock networks formed through Van der Waals forces ($\sim r^{-6}$) and dipole interactions ($\sim r^{-3}$)---interactions that depend on spatial configuration and electronic structure, not molecular velocity.

We prove eleven independent results that collectively dissolve the paradox: (1) \textit{Temporal triviality}: any configuration the demon purportedly creates will occur naturally through thermal fluctuations, rendering the demon redundant; (2) \textit{Phase-lock temperature independence}: the same phase-lock network (spatial arrangement and categorical structure) can exist at any temperature---a ``snapshot'' of positions is velocity-blind; (3) \textit{The retrieval paradox}: velocity-based sorting is self-defeating because thermal equilibration ($\sim 10^{10}$ collisions/s) randomises velocities faster than any sorting can occur, requiring infinite retrieval operations; (4) \textit{Phase-lock kinetic independence}: $\partial \phaselockgraph / \partial E_{\text{kin}} = 0$---network topology does not depend on molecular velocities; (5) \textit{Categorical-physical distance inequivalence}: categorical adjacency does not correspond to spatial proximity or kinetic similarity; (6) \textit{Temperature emergence}: temperature is a statistical observable of phase-lock cluster structure, not a sorting criterion; (7) \textit{Information complementarity}: information has two conjugate faces (kinetic and categorical) that cannot be simultaneously observed, analogous to ammeter/voltmeter measurement incompatibility in electrical circuits---Maxwell observed only the kinetic face; (8) \textit{Symmetric entropy increase}: every door operation increases entropy in \textit{both} containers through categorical completion and phase-lock network densification, regardless of which molecule transfers or its velocity; (9) \textit{Heat-entropy decoupling}: heat transfer and entropy change are fundamentally decoupled---individual collisions at the demon's door can transfer heat in either direction (including cold$\to$hot), yet entropy increases regardless, because heat is a statistical emergent property while entropy is a categorical fundamental property; (10) \textit{Velocity-temperature non-correspondence}: velocity distributions of containers at different temperatures overlap completely, meaning the same velocity corresponds to ``fast'' (hot) in a colder ensemble and ``slow'' (cold) in a hotter ensemble---temperature is not a molecular property, and sorting by velocity does not sort by temperature; (11) \textit{Velocity-entropy independence}: entropy counts spatial arrangements, not velocities---elastic collisions can change temperature without changing entropy, a snapshot is velocity-blind, and velocity-sorting is categorically orthogonal to entropy.

Result (11) reveals the most fundamental defeat: entropy counts spatial arrangements ($S = k_B \ln \Omega$), and velocity is orthogonal to arrangement count ($\partial \Omega / \partial v = 0$). Elastic collisions redistribute velocities without changing positions---temperature can increase while entropy remains constant. A configurational snapshot is velocity-blind: the same spatial arrangement exists at any temperature. The demon manipulates velocity, but entropy depends on arrangements. This is a category error: treating kinetic properties (velocity) as if they determined configurational properties (entropy). The demon's entire strategy operates in the wrong category.

What appeared to require an information-processing agent is revealed as topological navigation through categorical state space. This resolution requires no information-theoretic arguments, no quantum considerations, and no appeal to measurement costs---the paradox is resolved purely through the geometry of phase-lock networks and the mathematics of categorical completion.

Furthermore, the symmetric entropy increase principle extends to chemical equilibrium: Le Chatelier's principle emerges as the system seeking entropy production rate balance. Equilibrium is not where reactions stop, but where forward and reverse reactions produce entropy at equal rates. This unifies Maxwell's Demon, Gibbs' paradox, and Le Chatelier's principle within a single categorical framework.

\section{Introduction}
%==============================================================================

\subsection{The Paradox}

In 1867, James Clerk Maxwell introduced a thought experiment that has challenged thermodynamic foundations for over 150 years \citep{maxwell1871theory}. Consider two chambers A and B containing gas at thermal equilibrium, separated by a partition with a small door controlled by ``a being whose faculties are so sharpened that he can follow every molecule in its course.'' This being---the demon---observes molecules approaching the door and selectively opens it to allow fast molecules to pass from A to B and slow molecules from B to A. After sufficient operation, chamber B contains predominantly fast (hot) molecules while chamber A contains slow (cold) molecules, creating a temperature difference from equilibrium without apparent work expenditure.

The paradox is immediate: the second law of thermodynamics prohibits spontaneous heat flow from cold to hot, yet the demon appears to achieve precisely this through information alone. The total entropy of the system appears to decrease:
\begin{equation}
\Delta S_{\text{total}} = \Delta S_A + \Delta S_B < 0
\label{eq:entropy_decrease}
\end{equation}
contradicting the fundamental requirement $\Delta S \geq 0$ for isolated systems.

\subsection{Standard Resolutions and Their Limitations}

The dominant resolution, developed through contributions by Szilard \citep{szilard1929entropieverminderung}, Brillouin \citep{brillouin1951maxwells}, Landauer \citep{landauer1961irreversibility}, and Bennett \citep{bennett1982thermodynamics}, locates the entropy cost in information processing:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Measurement cost}: The demon must acquire information about molecular velocities, requiring interaction with the molecules that generates entropy.

    \item \textbf{Memory erasure}: The demon's memory, after accumulating sorting decisions, must eventually be erased. Landauer's principle establishes that erasing one bit of information dissipates at least $kT \ln 2$ of heat, generating entropy $\Delta S \geq k \ln 2$ per bit.

    \item \textbf{Computational irreversibility}: Bennett showed that logically irreversible operations (including measurement with finite memory) necessarily produce entropy, offsetting any decrease from sorting.
\end{enumerate}

These resolutions, while logically consistent, suffer from a fundamental limitation: they accept the demon's operation as given and locate entropy production in ancillary processes. They answer ``how does sorting avoid violating the second law?'' rather than questioning whether sorting occurs at all.

We propose a more radical resolution: \textit{there is no demon because there is no sorting by kinetic energy}. The apparent sorting is a manifestation of categorical completion through phase-lock network topology---a process requiring no information, no measurement, and no decision-making.

\subsection{The Phase-Lock Network Perspective}

Gas molecules are not independent particles moving through empty space. They exist in networks of phase-locked oscillatory relationships mediated by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Van der Waals forces: induced dipole-dipole interactions scaling as $U_{vdW} \propto r^{-6}$
    \item Permanent dipole interactions: scaling as $U_{\text{dipole}} \propto r^{-3}$
    \item Vibrational coupling: molecular vibrations synchronised through collisions
    \item Rotational coordination: orientational correlations through multipole moments
\end{itemize}

Crucially, \textit{none of these interactions depend on molecular kinetic energy}. Van der Waals forces depend on polarisability and separation; dipole interactions depend on molecular geometry and orientation; vibrational coupling depends on normal mode frequencies. A molecule's translational velocity---the quantity the demon supposedly measures---is irrelevant to phase-lock network formation.

This observation inverts the standard picture:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
\textbf{Standard View} & \textbf{Phase-Lock View} \\
\hline
Temperature $\to$ molecular speeds & Phase-lock topology $\to$ categorical structure \\
Demon measures velocity & No measurement needed \\
Sorting creates order & Topology reveals pre-existing structure \\
Information processing required & Categorical completion sufficient
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Central Claims}

This paper establishes four central results:

\begin{theorem}[Phase-Lock Kinetic Independence]
\label{thm:kinetic_independence_intro}
The phase-lock network $\phaselockgraph = (V, E)$ of a gas system satisfies:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \phaselockgraph}{\partial E_{\text{kin}}} = 0
\end{equation}
Network topology is determined by spatial configuration and electronic structure, independent of molecular velocities.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Categorical-Physical Distance Inequivalence]
\label{thm:distance_inequivalence_intro}
For categorical distance $d_{\catspace}$ and physical distance $d_{\text{phys}}$:
\begin{equation}
d_{\catspace}(C_i, C_j) \neq f(d_{\text{phys}}(\mathbf{r}_i, \mathbf{r}_j))
\end{equation}
for any function $f$. Categorical adjacency does not correspond to spatial proximity.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Temperature Emergence]
\label{thm:temperature_emergence_intro}
Temperature $T$ emerges as a statistical property of phase-lock cluster structure:
\begin{equation}
T = \mathcal{F}[\{\phaselockgraph_\alpha\}]
\end{equation}
where $\{\phaselockgraph_\alpha\}$ denotes the ensemble of phase-lock clusters. Temperature does not determine network structure; network structure determines apparent temperature.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Symmetric Entropy Increase]
\label{thm:symmetric_entropy_intro}
Every door operation by the demon increases entropy in both containers:
\begin{equation}
\Delta S_A > 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \Delta S_B > 0
\end{equation}
regardless of which molecule transfers or its velocity. This follows from applying the categorical resolution of Gibbs' paradox to single-molecule transfer.
\end{theorem}

From these results, the resolution follows: Maxwell's Demon dissolves because the ``sorting'' it supposedly performs is categorical completion through phase-lock topology. Molecules following phase-lock adjacency relations appear sorted by temperature because phase-lock clusters correlate with---but are not caused by---kinetic properties. Most directly, every door operation increases entropy in both containers through categorical completion (Theorem~\ref{thm:symmetric_entropy_intro}), making entropy decrease impossible regardless of the demon's strategy.

\subsection{Paper Structure}

Section~\ref{sec:phase_lock} establishes the mathematical framework for phase-lock networks and proves kinetic independence. Section~\ref{sec:categorical} develops categorical completion theory in the context of gas dynamics. Section~\ref{sec:virtual_gas} introduces the virtual gas ensemble---the demonstration that hardware oscillations constitute a categorical gas where molecules are created through measurement and spatial distance becomes irrelevant. Section~\ref{sec:selection} analyses how categorical selection opens accessibility pathways. Section~\ref{sec:temperature} proves that temperature emerges from phase-lock statistics. Section~\ref{sec:entropy} establishes the entropy mechanism through network topology, proving that every door operation increases entropy in \textit{both} containers through the connection to Gibbs' paradox resolution. Section~\ref{sec:lechatelier} extends the framework to chemical equilibrium, showing that Le Chatelier's principle emerges from entropy production rate balance---equilibrium is the point where forward and reverse reactions produce entropy at equal rates. Section~\ref{sec:heat_transfer} establishes the fundamental decoupling of heat and entropy: heat can flow in either direction in individual collisions while entropy always increases, revealing that the demon attacks a statistical emergent property (heat) while the Second Law protects a categorical fundamental property (entropy). Section~\ref{sec:velocity_overlap} demonstrates that velocity distributions overlap completely between containers at different temperatures, meaning the same velocity corresponds to ``fast'' in a colder ensemble and ``slow'' in a hotter ensemble---temperature is not a molecular property, and sorting by velocity cannot sort by temperature. Section~\ref{sec:velocity_entropy} establishes that velocity and entropy are categorically orthogonal: entropy counts spatial arrangements, elastic collisions can change temperature without entropy change, and the demon commits a category error by treating kinetic properties as configurational. Section~\ref{sec:dissolution} presents the complete dissolution of the demon paradox. Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes with implications and experimental predictions.

\subsection{Summary of Results}

We have presented a complete resolution of Maxwell's Demon paradox through the theory of categorical phase-lock networks. The resolution rests on eleven independent pillars:

\textbf{(1) Temporal triviality.} The demon is redundant. Any configuration it purportedly creates will occur naturally through thermal fluctuations (Poincaré recurrence). The demon accelerates what statistical mechanics already predicts will happen---but acceleration is not violation.

\textbf{(2) Phase-lock temperature independence.} A ``snapshot'' of the system---frozen molecular positions and phase-lock relationships---can exist at any temperature. The same spatial arrangement is compatible with 100 K or 1000 K. The demon's ``sorting'' is rearrangement by phase-lock structure, which is velocity-blind.

\textbf{(3) The retrieval paradox.} Velocity-based sorting is self-defeating. Thermal equilibration occurs on the collision timescale ($\sim 10^{-10}$ s), randomising velocities continuously. A demon sorting by velocity must retrieve molecules that change speed after sorting---requiring $\sim 10^{33}$ operations per second, an infinite loop of sorting and retrieval.

\textbf{(4) Phase-lock kinetic independence.} The interactions forming phase-lock relationships---Van der Waals forces, dipole couplings, vibrational synchronisation---depend on spatial configuration and electronic structure, not molecular velocity. Theorem~\ref{thm:kinetic_independence_intro} establishes $\partial \phaselockgraph / \partial E_{\text{kin}} = 0$: network topology is blind to kinetic energy.

\textbf{(5) Categorical-physical distance inequivalence.} Molecules can be categorically adjacent (phase-locked) while physically distant, and physically proximate while categorically separated. The categorical state space $\catspace$ has geometry determined by phase-lock topology, not Euclidean metrics.

\textbf{(6) Temperature emergence.} Temperature is a macroscopic observable that emerges from the statistical properties of phase-lock clusters, not a sorting criterion. The correlation between phase-lock structure and kinetic energy is real but not causal.

\textbf{(7) Information complementarity.} Information has two conjugate faces---the kinetic face (velocities, temperatures) and the categorical face (phase-lock networks, categorical completion)---that cannot be simultaneously observed, analogous to ammeter/voltmeter complementarity in electrical circuits. Maxwell observed only the kinetic face; the ``demon'' was the projection of hidden categorical dynamics onto his observable face. The demon appeared intelligent because categorical completion follows structured (topological) pathways, which look like purposeful selection when projected onto the kinetic face.

\textbf{(8) Symmetric entropy increase.} Every door operation increases entropy in \textit{both} containers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{losing container} (A): The $N-1$ remaining molecules must form a new phase-lock network. By categorical completion, this new state $C_{A'}$ satisfies $C_A \prec C_{A'}$---it is categorically advanced, hence higher entropy.
    \item The \textbf{receiving container} (B): The new molecule brings new phase-lock edges, exactly as in mixing. The network densifies: $|E_{B'}| > |E_B|$, hence higher entropy.
\end{itemize}
This follows directly from the categorical resolution of Gibbs' paradox: mixing-reseparation \textit{always} increases entropy through phase-lock network densification. Maxwell saw entropy changes but misattributed them to ``velocity sorting.'' In reality, \textit{any} molecule transfer---fast, slow, or random---increases total entropy. The demon cannot decrease entropy regardless of its strategy.

\textbf{(9) Heat-entropy decoupling.} Heat and entropy are fundamentally decoupled:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Heat} is a statistical emergent property---individual collisions can transfer energy in either direction (hot$\to$cold or cold$\to$hot).
    \item \textbf{Entropy} is a categorical fundamental property---it always increases through phase-lock correlation formation.
\end{itemize}
Even if a particular collision at the demon's door transfers heat from cold to hot (an individual fluctuation permitted by microscopic dynamics), entropy still increases because the collision creates new phase-lock correlations. The Second Law constrains entropy, not heat direction. Maxwell conflated these quantities, framing the paradox in terms of heat (``heat cannot spontaneously flow cold$\to$hot'') when the actual constraint is on entropy (``entropy cannot decrease''). The demon attacks the wrong quantity: it manipulates heat while entropy remains protected.

\textbf{(10) Velocity-temperature non-correspondence.} Velocity distributions of different-temperature containers overlap completely. The same velocity $v$ corresponds to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``Fast'' (hot) in a colder ensemble where $v > \langle v \rangle_{\text{cold}}$
    \item ``Slow'' (cold) in a hotter ensemble where $v < \langle v \rangle_{\text{hot}}$
\end{itemize}
Temperature is not a molecular property---only ensembles have temperature. A molecule moving at 500 m/s is ``hot'' in a 300K container but ``cold'' in a 310K container. When the demon moves this molecule from cold to hot, its categorical meaning inverts: it was contributing to ``hotness'' in the source but now contributes to ``coldness'' in the destination. The demon cannot sort by temperature because: (a) molecules do not possess temperature, (b) velocity does not determine temperature contribution, and (c) the contribution depends on the destination ensemble, not the source. Sorting by velocity does not sort by temperature.

\textbf{(11) Velocity-entropy independence.} This is the most fundamental defeat. Entropy counts spatial arrangements: $S = k_B \ln \Omega$ where $\Omega$ is the number of ways molecules can be arranged. Velocity is the rate of change of position, not position itself:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\partial \Omega / \partial v_i = 0$: arrangement count is velocity-independent
    \item Elastic collisions redistribute velocities without changing spatial arrangement
    \item Temperature can change (via kinetic energy redistribution) while entropy remains constant
    \item A configurational snapshot is velocity-blind: the same arrangement exists at any temperature
\end{itemize}
The demon commits a \textit{category error}: treating kinetic properties (velocity) as if they determined configurational properties (entropy). Velocity-sorting is categorically orthogonal to entropy---the demon manipulates a quantity that has zero effect on the quantity protected by the Second Law.

\subsection{The Dissolution}

Maxwell's Demon does not violate the second law because there is no demon. The thought experiment posits an agent that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Measures molecular velocities
    \item Makes decisions based on measurements
    \item Controls a door to sort molecules
    \item Creates temperature differences without work
    \item Maintains the sorted state
\end{enumerate}

Our analysis reveals that each step is either unnecessary, misconceived, or impossible:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{No measurement needed}: Phase-lock network topology encodes categorical structure without any measurement. The ``information'' about which molecules belong together is structural, not acquired.

    \item \textbf{No decisions required}: Categorical completion follows network topology deterministically. Accessible states are determined by phase-lock adjacency, not by deliberation.

    \item \textbf{No door operation}: The partition between categorical clusters is topological, not physical. ``Opening the door'' is selecting a categorical state, which makes phase-lock adjacent states accessible.

    \item \textbf{No sorting by temperature}: Phase-lock structure is temperature-independent. The same categorical arrangement exists at any temperature---a snapshot of positions is velocity-blind. The demon sorts the wrong property.

    \item \textbf{No maintenance possible}: Even if sorting occurred, the demon cannot maintain it. Thermal equilibration randomises velocities on the collision timescale ($10^{-10}$ s). The demon would require infinite retrieval operations, defeating itself.

    \item \textbf{No special outcome}: The ``sorted'' configuration will occur naturally through fluctuations. The demon is temporally redundant---it creates nothing that wouldn't happen anyway.
\end{enumerate}

The demon dissolves into categorical completion:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\text{``Maxwell's Demon''} \equiv \text{Categorical Completion through Phase-Lock Topology}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Relationship to Information-Theoretic Resolutions}

Our resolution does not contradict Landauer-Bennett but renders it unnecessary for the core paradox. Information-theoretic resolutions correctly identify entropy costs of measurement and erasure---these costs are real. However, they address a demon that need not exist.

If one insists on constructing a physical demon (an actual device that measures and sorts), then information-theoretic constraints apply. But Maxwell's original thought experiment---and the thermodynamic puzzle it poses---dissolves once we recognise that phase-lock topology does the ``sorting'' without any agent.

\subsection{Implications}

The resolution has several implications:

\textbf{For thermodynamics}: The second law is preserved not through information costs but through categorical irreversibility. Entropy increases because categorical completion densifies phase-lock networks, regardless of apparent ``sorting.''

\textbf{For statistical mechanics}: Temperature is properly understood as emergent from categorical structure, not as a primitive quantity that determines molecular behaviour.

\textbf{For information theory}: The information content of a physical system resides in its categorical structure (phase-lock topology), not in externally acquired measurements.

\textbf{For the foundations of physics}: The demon paradox arose from treating molecules as independent particles with properties (velocity) to be measured. Recognising molecules as nodes in phase-lock networks dissolves the paradox and suggests a more relational ontology.

\textbf{For chemical equilibrium}: Le Chatelier's principle is revealed as entropy production rate balance. Equilibrium is not a static state but a dynamic balance where forward and reverse reactions produce entropy at equal rates. This unifies gas thermodynamics with chemical kinetics through categorical dynamics.

\subsection{Experimental Predictions}

The resolution makes testable predictions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Phase-lock correlation spectroscopy}: Categorical structure should be detectable through correlation measurements independent of temperature.

    \item \textbf{Isothermal categorical separation}: Under isothermal conditions, categorical clusters should remain distinguishable while temperature-based ``sorting'' is impossible.

    \item \textbf{Residual phase correlations}: After physical separation, molecules from the same categorical cluster should exhibit residual phase correlations detectable through interference measurements.

    \item \textbf{Network topology determines dynamics}: Molecular dynamics should follow phase-lock adjacency rather than kinetic energy similarity, testable through trajectory analysis.

    \item \textbf{Symmetric reaction entropy}: Both forward and reverse reactions should increase total entropy in both ``containers'' (reactants and products), measurable via precision calorimetry during chemical reactions.

    \item \textbf{Equilibrium entropy production}: At chemical equilibrium, entropy production continues in both directions at equal rates---not zero production. This dynamic balance is measurable through isotope labelling and reaction monitoring.

    \item \textbf{Perturbation response via entropy rates}: When equilibrium is perturbed, the system should shift in the direction of higher instantaneous entropy production rate, providing a kinetic rather than purely thermodynamic interpretation of Le Chatelier's principle.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Final Statement}

Maxwell's Demon has haunted thermodynamics for over 150 years, spawning profound insights into the relationships between information, entropy, and physical law. We have shown that the demon was never there---and could never have been there.

The demon fails on eleven independent counts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It is \textbf{redundant}: fluctuations produce the same configurations naturally.
    \item It is \textbf{misconceived}: phase-lock structure is temperature-independent.
    \item It is \textbf{self-defeating}: velocity-based sorting cannot outpace thermal equilibration.
    \item It is \textbf{unnecessary}: categorical structure requires no measurement.
    \item It is \textbf{automatic}: categorical completion follows topology without decisions.
    \item It is \textbf{entropy-increasing}: network densification increases total entropy.
    \item It is \textbf{a projection artefact}: the ``demon'' is how hidden categorical dynamics appear when projected onto the observable kinetic face.
    \item It is \textbf{symmetrically defeated}: every door operation increases entropy in \textit{both} containers---the losing container through categorical completion, the receiving container through mixing-type densification---regardless of molecular velocity.
    \item It is \textbf{fundamentally misdirected}: the demon manipulates heat (a statistical emergent property) while the Second Law protects entropy (a categorical fundamental property)---even ``successful'' heat reversals increase entropy.
    \item It is \textbf{conceptually incoherent}: temperature is not a molecular property, velocity distributions overlap completely, and sorting by velocity cannot sort by temperature---the same velocity is ``hot'' in one context and ``cold'' in another.
    \item It is \textbf{categorically orthogonal}: velocity and entropy are in different categories---kinetic versus configurational. Entropy counts spatial arrangements ($\partial \Omega / \partial v = 0$), and velocity-sorting has zero effect on arrangement count. The demon commits a category error.
\end{enumerate}

The ``sorting'' that appeared to require an intelligent agent is the natural dynamics of categorical completion through phase-lock network topology. The paradox dissolves not through finding where entropy is produced, but through recognising that the sorting operation was always a manifestation of pre-existing categorical structure---and that any attempt to sort by velocity would be defeated by thermal equilibration before it could succeed.

Most profoundly, we now understand \textit{why Maxwell saw a demon}. Information has two conjugate faces that cannot be simultaneously observed. Maxwell, confined to the kinetic face of information (velocities, temperatures, molecular speeds), saw structured ``sorting'' that appeared to require intelligent intervention. But the ``demon'' was simply the categorical face---the phase-lock network completing states according to topology---projected onto his observable face. Just as an ammeter cannot see voltage directly, Maxwell's theoretical apparatus could not see categorical dynamics directly. The demon was born from this observational constraint.

Any observer confined to one face of information will, when dynamics occur on the conjugate face, necessarily perceive those dynamics as external intervention. The demon is universal in this sense: it will appear whenever an observer sees only half of a two-faced information structure. The demon dissolves the moment the observer gains access to the conjugate face.

There is no demon. There is only the phase-lock network, completing its categorical states according to topology, indifferent to the velocities that Maxwell's thought experiment privileged but that physics does not. And there is the observer, looking at one face of information, inventing agents to explain what they cannot directly see.
