\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \caption{\textbf{Triple Equivalence: Virtual Gas Molecules as Pendulums.}
    This panel demonstrates that oscillatory dynamics, categorical states, and partition geometry 
    are three equivalent descriptions of the same physical reality.
    \textbf{(A)} Virtual gas molecules in a container, where each vibrational mode is represented 
    as a simple pendulum. The five molecules shown oscillate with different phases and frequencies, 
    but each follows the same underlying dynamics.
    \textbf{(B)} Oscillatory perspective: the pendulum traces a sinusoidal trajectory 
    $\theta(t) = \theta_0 \sin(\omega t)$ with period $T = 2\pi/\omega$. Quantum states 
    $|0\rangle, |1\rangle, \ldots$ emerge from energy quantization.
    \textbf{(C)} Categorical perspective: the pendulum's range is divided into $n = 8$ 
    distinguishable positions $C_1, \ldots, C_8$. Each position $\theta_i$ is a categorical 
    state that the system occupies at different times.
    \textbf{(D)} Partition perspective: the oscillation period is represented as a hierarchical 
    tree with depth $M$ and branching factor $n$. The total number of terminal states (leaves) 
    is $n^M$.
    \textbf{(E)} The fundamental equivalence: all three perspectives are mathematically 
    equivalent, differing only in vocabulary. The equivalence symbol ($\equiv$) indicates 
    that oscillation, category, and partition descriptions yield identical physical predictions.
    \textbf{(F)} Parameter correspondence table showing how concepts map across frameworks. 
    Degrees of freedom ($M$) correspond to modes, dimensions, or tree levels; states per 
    degree of freedom ($n$) correspond to quantum numbers, categorical levels, or branching 
    factor. All three yield the same entropy: $S = k_B M \ln n$.}

% FIGURE 2: Entropy Derivation - S = k_B M ln n

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../shared-figures/figures/panel2_entropy_derivation.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Entropy Derivation from Three Equivalent Perspectives.}
    This panel shows how the unified entropy formula $S = k_B M \ln n$ emerges identically 
    from oscillatory, categorical, and partition frameworks.
    \textbf{(A)} Oscillatory state counting: for a system with $M = 3$ independent modes, 
    each with $n = 4$ quantum states, the total number of microstates is 
    $W_{\text{osc}} = n^M = 4^3 = 64$.
    \textbf{(B)} Categorical state counting: a categorical space with $M = 2$ dimensions, 
    each having $n = 4$ levels, contains $|\mathcal{C}| = n^M = 4^2 = 16$ distinguishable 
    states (shown as circles $C_{i,j}$).
    \textbf{(C)} Partition path counting: a partition tree with $M = 2$ levels and 
    branching factor $n = 3$ has $n^M = 3^2 = 9$ unique paths from root to leaves 
    (one path highlighted in red).
    \textbf{(D)} Boltzmann's fundamental relation $S = k_B \ln W$ combined with the 
    microstate count $W = n^M$ yields the unified entropy formula $S = k_B M \ln n$ 
    through logarithmic expansion.
    \textbf{(E)} Convergence diagram: all three frameworks (oscillatory, categorical, 
    partition) independently yield $W = n^M$, which through Boltzmann's relation gives 
    the same entropy formula.
    \textbf{(F)} Entropy scaling plot showing how $S/k_B = M \ln n$ varies with 
    degrees of freedom $M$ and states per DOF $n$. Entropy scales linearly with $M$ 
    (horizontal direction) and logarithmically with $n$ (vertical direction). 
    A simple pendulum ($M = 1$, $n = 4$) and a gas molecule ($M = 6$, $n = 3$) 
    are marked as reference points.}

% FIGURE 3: Categorical Enthalpy - H = U + Σn_a Φ_a → U + PV
%=============================================================================
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../shared-figures/figures/panel3_categorical_enthalpy.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Categorical Enthalpy: From Aperture Selectivity to Classical Thermodynamics.}
    This panel derives classical enthalpy $H = U + PV$ as the coarse-grained limit of 
    categorical aperture dynamics.
    \textbf{(A)} Aperture concept: a membrane with an aperture selectively allows 
    passage of molecules based on their categorical properties. Small molecules (green) 
    pass through; large molecules (red) are blocked. The selectivity $s_a = \Omega_{\text{pass}}/\Omega_{\text{total}}$ 
    ranges from $s = 0$ (impermeable) to $s = 1$ (fully permeable).
    \textbf{(B)} Categorical potential vs.\ selectivity: the potential 
    $\Phi_a = -k_B T \ln s_a$ diverges as $s_a \to 0$ (impermeable barrier) and 
    vanishes as $s_a \to 1$ (no barrier). The curve shows how selective apertures 
    create entropic barriers.
    \textbf{(C)} Categorical enthalpy definition: for a system with internal energy $U$ 
    and multiple apertures on its boundary, the categorical enthalpy is 
    $\mathcal{H} = U + \sum_a n_a \Phi_a$, where $n_a$ is the number of type-$a$ 
    apertures and $\Phi_a$ is their categorical potential.
    \textbf{(D)} Classical limit: as aperture selectivity approaches unity ($s_a \to 1$) 
    and aperture density increases ($n_a \to \infty$), the discrete sum of aperture 
    potentials becomes a surface integral, yielding $\sum_a n_a \Phi_a \to \int_{\partial\Omega} P \, dA = PV$.
    \textbf{(E)} Pressure emergence: pressure is defined as the coarse-grained limit 
    of aperture potential density, $P = \lim_{s_a \to 1} \rho_a \cdot (-k_B T \ln s_a)$, 
    where $\rho_a$ is the aperture density per unit area.
    \textbf{(F)} Enthalpy hierarchy: the categorical enthalpy 
    $\mathcal{H} = U + \int_{\partial\Omega} \sigma(x) \cdot \phi(x) \, dA$ (fundamental) 
    reduces to classical enthalpy $H = U + PV$ (coarse-grained) when local selectivity 
    $\sigma(x) \to 1$ and local potential $\phi(x) \to P$. Classical thermodynamics 
    emerges as the coarse-grained limit of categorical aperture dynamics.}
