The partition framework makes testable predictions:

\subsubsection{Partition Lag Timescales}
Measurements should exhibit minimum timescales $\taulag$ below which entropy production is suppressed. For quantum measurements:
\begin{equation}
\taulag \sim \frac{\hbar}{\Delta E}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta E$ is the energy uncertainty of the measurement.

\subsubsection{Entropy of Measurement}
The entropy produced by velocity measurement should scale as $N \kB \ln n_v$, testable in controlled systems where $N$ and $n_v$ are known.

\subsubsection{Spin Echo Limits}
Spin echo experiments, which partially reverse entropy production, should exhibit fundamental limits set by partition entropy of the reversal pulse itself.
