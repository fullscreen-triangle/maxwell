    "Programs are catalytic structures (partitions + apertures), not instructions",
    "Execution is gas dynamics, not step-by-step operation",
    "Solutions are equilibrium states, not computed outputs",
    "Aperture traversal is velocity-independent (geometry only)",
    "Catalysts are ignorant of solutions - they define constraints, not answers",

    "Autocatalytic feedback: each transit reduces resistance",
